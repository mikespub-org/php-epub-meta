            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <div>

                <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,
                    <br />
                    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
                    <br />
                    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
                    <br />
                    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
                    <br />
                    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
                    <br />
                    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
                    <br />
                    Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
                    <br />
                    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
                    <br />
                    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
                    <br />
                    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
                    <br />
                    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
                    <br />
                    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
                    <br />
                    The which if you with patient ears attend,
                    <br />
                    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
                </p>
