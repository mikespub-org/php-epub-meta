            <strong>BENVOLIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
            <br />
            The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
            <br />
            And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
            <br />
            For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
            <br />
            enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
            <br />
            upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
            <br />
            thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
            <br />
            it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>BENVOLIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Am I like such a fellow?
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
            <br />
            any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
            <br />
            soon moody to be moved.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>BENVOLIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>And what to?
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
            <br />
            shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
            <br />
            thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
            <br />
            or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
            <br />
            wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
            <br />
            other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
            <br />
            eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
            <br />
            Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
            <br />
            meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
            <br />
            an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
            <br />
            man for coughing in the street, because he hath
            <br />
            wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
            <br />
            didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
            <br />
            his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
            <br />
            tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
            <br />
            wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>BENVOLIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
            <br />
            should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a
            quarter.
            <br />

        <p>By my head, here come the Capulets.

        </p>

        <p>Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
            <br />
            Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>And but one word with one of us? couple it with
            <br />
            something; make it a word and a blow.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>TYBALT</strong>
        </p>

        <p>You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
            <br />
            will give me occasion.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Could you not take some occasion without giving?
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>TYBALT</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,—

        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
            <br />
            thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
            <br />
            discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
            <br />
            make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>BENVOLIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>We talk here in the public haunt of men:
            <br />
            Either withdraw unto some private place,
            <br />
            And reason coldly of your grievances,
            <br />
            Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
            <br />
            I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
            <br />
            Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
            <br />
            Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

        </p>

        <p>Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
            <br />
            No better term than this,—thou art a villain.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>ROMEO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
            <br />
            Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
            <br />
            To such a greeting: villain am I none;
            <br />
            Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>TYBALT</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
            <br />
            That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>ROMEO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>I do protest, I never injured thee,
            <br />
            But love thee better than thou canst devise,
            <br />
            Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
            <br />
            And so, good Capulet,—which name I tender
            <br />
            As dearly as my own,—be satisfied.

            Alla stoccata carries it away.

        <p>Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
            <br />
            lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you

            shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the

            <br />
            by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
            <br />
            ears ere it be out.

        <p>Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
            <br />
            Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
            <br />
            Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
            <br />
            Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
            <br />
            Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his

        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MERCUTIO</strong>
        </p>

            A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
            <br />
            Is he gone, and hath nothing?

            Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

        <p>No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a

            church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
            <br />
            me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
            <br />
            am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
            <br />
            both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
            <br />
            cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
            <br />
            rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
            <br />
            arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
            <br />
            was hurt under your arm.

            Is but a little way above our heads,

            Staying for thine to keep him company:

            If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

        <p>Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
            <br />
            Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

        <p>Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>BENVOLIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>O noble prince, I can discover all
            <br />
            The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
            <br />
            There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
            <br />
            That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>LADY CAPULET</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
            <br />
            O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
            <br />
            O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
            <br />
            For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
            <br />
            O cousin, cousin!
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>PRINCE</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>BENVOLIO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
            <br />
            Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
            <br />
            How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
            <br />
            Your high displeasure: all this uttered
            <br />
            With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
            <br />
            Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
            <br />
            Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
            <br />
            With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
            <br />
            Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
            <br />
            And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
            <br />
            Cold death aside, and with the other sends
            <br />
            It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
            <br />
            Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
            <br />
            'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
            <br />
            his tongue,
            <br />
            His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
            <br />
            And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
            <br />
            An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
            <br />
            Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
            <br />
            But by and by comes back to Romeo,
            <br />
            Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
            <br />
            And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
            <br />
            Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
            <br />
            And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
            <br />
            This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>LADY CAPULET</strong>
        </p>

        <p>He is a kinsman to the Montague;
            <br />
            Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
            <br />
            Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
            <br />
            And all those twenty could but kill one life.
            <br />
            I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
            <br />
            Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>PRINCE</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
            <br />
            Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>MONTAGUE</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
            <br />
            His fault concludes but what the law should end,
            <br />
            The life of Tybalt.
            <br />
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>PRINCE</strong>
        </p>

        <p>And for that offence
            <br />
            Immediately we do exile him hence:
            <br />
            I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
            <br />
            My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
            <br />
            But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
            <br />
            That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
            <br />
            I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
            <br />
            Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
            <br />
            Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
            <br />
            Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
            <br />
            Bear hence this body and attend our will:
            <br />
            Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>Exeunt</p>
